 *
 * Tumanako Sensor Class Interface:
 *
 * Provides a basic sensor definition for several kinds of
 * sensor. Currently:
 *
 *  Vehicle Data - Some connection to the vehicle (probably Bluetooth or USB)
 *  NMEA GPS     - For position, etc. Uses system location services
 *
 * The following methods must be implemented for all tumanako sensors /
 * data sources:
 *
 * isOK()      - Returns a boolean indicating whether the sensor is available
 * isRunning() - Returns a boolean indicating whether the sensor is generating data
 *
 * resume()    - Start taking readings. The sensor will start generating messages.
 *
 * suspend()   - Stop the sensor from taking readings. This should leave the sensor
 *               in a state which does NOT use CPU time or batteries - suitable
 *               for if the application is put into the background indefinitely.
 *
 * toString()  - Return useful sensor info as a string. Used for debugging.
 *
 *
 * The general lifecycle of a sensor is:
 *
 * Create - The constructor is called when a new instance is created. This should
 *          set up the sensor but NOT start it (i.e. it shouldn't start
 *          generating messages or using CPU / Battery time)
 *
 * resume() - Called when the UI or parent is ready to receive messages. turn 'On'
 *            the sensor.
 *
 * suspend() - Called when the sensor should stop using CPU / Batteries and stop
 *             generating messages - e.g. when the UI activity goes into the background
 *             or is closed.
 *
 *             After suspend(), resume() may be called later when the UI is re-displayed,
 *             or the OS may trash the app in which case resume() will never be called.
 *             Thus, suspend() should unregister any sensors or system services and
 *             leave things in a state where they don't waste power or CPU time.
